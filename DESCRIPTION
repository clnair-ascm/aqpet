Description: The 'aqpet' package provides a comprehensive toolkit for streamlined analysis of policy interventions, 
             utilizing 'h2o' for automated machine learning, weather normalization approaches to isolate human-related trends, 
             and ASCM for counterfactual comparison between policy-implementing and control cities. Data are typically 
             regular time series air quality and meteorological data. This package enables precise and efficient air 
             quality policy evaluation, aiding informed urban air quality management.
